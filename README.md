The first version was originally six hours long, but was trimmed at the request of the producers.

Following its release, it won many awards and received acclaim from critics.[1] At the Berlin International Film Festival, it won the Caligari Film Award and the FIPRESCI Prize.[2]

Plot
Yū Honda is a young teenager Catholic attempting to live his life faithfully. His father, Tetsu, has become a devout Catholic priest following the death of Yū's mother and operates his own church. Tetsu asks Yū to confess his sins, but Yū believes he is a good person who has little to confess. To appease his father, he makes up sins but his father sees right through him so Yū becomes obsessed with committing real sins. Yū befriends other boys and is taught to steal, fight, and take stealth photographs up women's skirts. Yū promptly becomes a skilled "panty shot" photographer. Though perceived as a pervert, he is never aroused by these photographs.

After Yū loses a bet with his friends, he agrees to go into the city dressed as a woman and kiss a girl he likes. When they go into the city, Yū and his friends come across Yōko, his "Virgin Mary" who is surrounded by a group of thugs. Still dressed as a woman, he helps Yōko, a skilled fighter herself, beat up the gang. Afterwards he kisses Yōko and runs away. Yū falls in love with her – the first time he's been in love with a girl - but Yōko falls for his disguise and develops feelings for his alter ego Sasori, or "Miss Scorpion".

Meanwhile, Yū is being followed by Aya Koike, a member of the cult "Zero Church", who has become infatuated with him after she catches him taking a picture of her panties. Aya, who turned violent after being sexually abused to the point of insanity, plans to bring Yū's entire family into the Zero Church and masquerades as Sasori to gain Yōko's favor.

Aya manipulates those around Yū and Yōko and Yū's family become caught up in the Zero Church. Yū desperately tries to free Yōko from the cult by kidnapping her but fails to persuade her to leave as she does not trust him to be Miss Scorpion and is convinced he is a pervert. Armed with a sword, Yū breaks into the Zero Church's building and again tries to escape with Yōko. Aya, who is present along with Yū's family, fights back, but commits suicide by driving the sword through her stomach when she realizes Yū's love for Yōko.

Yū is taken to a mental hospital, where he has forgotten all of his past and convinced himself that he is really Sasori. Yōko comes to visit, claiming that she now realises that she loves him as he was the one always trying to save her. Yū cannot remember who she is, so security escort the hysterical Yōko out of the building. Moments later, Yū remembers her and escapes from the hospital, running after the car driving Yōko away. Yū catches up, smashes open the car window, and joins hands with Yōko.

Additional Information
Missed tests/exams will not be rescheduled without some valid evidence of some important
event over which the student has no control (e.g., Court appearance, death in the family).
Missed tests or exams, therefore, can receive a zero. The students are advised to notify the
professor prior to missing the test.
Students are expected to hand in all assignments to the course instructor on the due date,
and all assignments must be submitted in the format specified by the instructor (e.g., on
FOL, in printed form, on a specific lab computer, etc.); assignments will not be accepted in
any format other than that specified.

Late assignments will not be accepted, nor will make up test or assignments be permitted,
without some valid evidence of some important event over which the student has no control
(e.g., documented illness, death in the family). Missed tests or assignments, therefore, will
receive a mark of zero. Late assignments and make-up tests will only be permitted following
the submission of adequate documentation acceptable to the instructor (e.g., a doctor's
note). Students are advised to notify the instructor prior to missing an assignment due date
or a scheduled test.

Immediately upon return from an illness/absence in which a test or assignment has been
missed, the student is responsible for contacting the course instructor to discuss the
problem. The instructor will make arrangements for any student deemed eligible. The
alternative test/assignment will be of equal value to the one missed with no grade penalty.
The timeline and due dates will be determined by the course instructor.
At mid-term, any unsatisfactory results will be reported to the student.
This course may be revised by the professor with suitable notification to the students.
Students are responsible for making arrangements to pick up missed handouts, assignments
and course announcements from classmates.

Plagiarism (e.g., failure to acknowledge sources used, submitting another student's work
under your name, or producing work for another student to submit) is a serious academic
offense that shall result in appropriate penalties, to be determined at the discretion of the
course professor in consultation with the chairperson of the Communication Arts division.
The penalties shall range from failure of an assignment to possible failure of the course.
Students shall not make the assumption that any provision will be made by the professor
