CSS Selection and Styles

Exploring Authoring Techniques - Authoring 1

Assignment Description
Choose characters from a comic, movie or TV series. Use the Marvel class build; replace the
existing logo with one that matches your selection. Update the colours throughout (the
header background colour, the red bumper bars, text colour etc)
Choose a different theme for the page - different background images, etc. Make it your own.
You can use the same classes and IDs as the class build, but change the colour values etc -
explore whatâ€™s possible with CSS.
Update the Marvel Characters Photoshop sprite sheet, re-export it and use it on the page
for your main character images.
Update 2 of the lightboxes to show more content on click; the background image in each of
those lightboxes should be different. You might need to change the layout of the text and
images in the lightbox - explore how to do this with margins, padding, floats etc.
The text content in the lightbox can remain placeholder-only (lorem ipsum).
Create a well-written readme file and branches as necessary, following workflow as
demonstrated in class. Use pull requests and merge as you go.

Additional Information
Missed tests/exams will not be rescheduled without some valid evidence of some important
event over which the student has no control (e.g., Court appearance, death in the family).
Missed tests or exams, therefore, can receive a zero. The students are advised to notify the
professor prior to missing the test.
Students are expected to hand in all assignments to the course instructor on the due date,
and all assignments must be submitted in the format specified by the instructor (e.g., on
FOL, in printed form, on a specific lab computer, etc.); assignments will not be accepted in
any format other than that specified.

Late assignments will not be accepted, nor will make up test or assignments be permitted,
without some valid evidence of some important event over which the student has no control
(e.g., documented illness, death in the family). Missed tests or assignments, therefore, will
receive a mark of zero. Late assignments and make-up tests will only be permitted following
the submission of adequate documentation acceptable to the instructor (e.g., a doctor's
note). Students are advised to notify the instructor prior to missing an assignment due date
or a scheduled test.

Immediately upon return from an illness/absence in which a test or assignment has been
missed, the student is responsible for contacting the course instructor to discuss the
problem. The instructor will make arrangements for any student deemed eligible. The
alternative test/assignment will be of equal value to the one missed with no grade penalty.
The timeline and due dates will be determined by the course instructor.
At mid-term, any unsatisfactory results will be reported to the student.
This course may be revised by the professor with suitable notification to the students.
Students are responsible for making arrangements to pick up missed handouts, assignments
and course announcements from classmates.

Plagiarism (e.g., failure to acknowledge sources used, submitting another student's work
under your name, or producing work for another student to submit) is a serious academic
offense that shall result in appropriate penalties, to be determined at the discretion of the
course professor in consultation with the chairperson of the Communication Arts division.
The penalties shall range from failure of an assignment to possible failure of the course.
Students shall not make the assumption that any provision will be made by the professor
